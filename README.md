### Project Overview

This project is an Advanced Statistics Analysis Workbook that applies statistical methodologies, including probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression models, to analyze various datasets. Key tasks involve exploring statistical models and applying techniques like Poisson distribution, hypothesis testing, and regularized regression to extract meaningful insights from data.

### Objectives

Probabilistic Analysis: Explore and visualize probability distributions, including Poisson and exponential distributions.
Hypothesis Testing: Conduct hypothesis tests on sample data to make statistically supported conclusions.
Regression Analysis: Use ordinary least squares (OLS) and ridge regularized regression for modeling relationships between variables.
Bayesian Estimation: Apply Bayesian methods to estimate distribution parameters based on prior and observed data.

### Solution Highlights

Visualizations: Generate graphs and histograms for data distributions, probabilities, and regression model comparisons.
Model Development: Implement statistical models in Python, leveraging libraries like pandas, numpy, and plotly.
Statistical Computations: Calculate key metrics, including means, variances, confidence intervals, and error probabilities.

### Key Outcomes

This workbook enhances the understanding of statistical concepts by offering hands-on tasks that cover advanced statistical applications in data analysis. It serves as a practical resource for mastering probabilistic models, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian estimation in Python.
